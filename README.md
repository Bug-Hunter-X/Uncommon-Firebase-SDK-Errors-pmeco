# Uncommon Firebase SDK Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon error scenarios that can occur when using the Firebase SDK:

1. **Missing or Invalid Configuration:** The Firebase SDK requires a correctly configured `firebaseConfig` object for initialization. Missing or incorrect values will lead to errors.
2. **Asynchronous Operation Order:**  Improper handling of asynchronous operations, especially within Cloud Functions, can result in unexpected behavior and errors due to race conditions.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows examples of these errors, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides solutions.
