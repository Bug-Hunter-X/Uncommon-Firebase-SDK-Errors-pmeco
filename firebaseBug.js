The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is missing required fields or contains invalid values. This can happen when initializing Firebase using an incorrect configuration object obtained from your Firebase console, or if the configuration object is modified incorrectly.  Another uncommon error involves issues with asynchronous operations not properly handling the order of execution within Firebase functions. For example, if a function depends on data from another asynchronous operation which hasn't completed, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
